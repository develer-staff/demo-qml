demo-qml
========
This is a demo for the QtQuick/QML framework, part of [Qt by Digia][1]. This demo has been designed to run on an embedded device with multi-touch screen, but it can also be tested on Linux and Mac OSX.

The demo is released under the New BSD license (see [LICENSE.bsd][2]) by [Develer][3], a consultancy company specialized in R&D software development with Qt (we are Qt Certified partners). We can help you make your QtQuick-based product, both on desktop and embedded platforms, just [write us][4]!

This is a preview of the demo:

### How to run it
demo-qml is a standard QtQuick project, so you can simply load the project through Qt Creator and run it (or use qmake from the command line).
